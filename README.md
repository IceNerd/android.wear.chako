# Chako Watch Face

I made this watch face shortly after purchasing my first Android watch. Expanding on the simplicity of the watch I added a configuration activity which allows the user to snap a still image from the camera then pick a color from the captured image. The color is used to render the watch face in the best way possible.

## todo

* update to sdk 23
** permission model (camera)
** Camera2 implementation instead of deprecated Camera
